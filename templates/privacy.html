That's why we have put a policy in place to protect your personal information. Please read on for more details about our Privacy practices.</p>

	  <h3>What information does {{ sitename }} collect? How do we use it?</h3>

	  <p>At times we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information. Generally this information is requested when you register for an online service or when you provide information in connection with an online transaction.</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>When you order, we ask you for your name, e-mail address, shipping and billing addresses, telephone number. Since we are using <a href="https://www.paypal.com" title="PayPal">PayPal</a> as our payment gateway, we are not keeping your credit card information anyway. All payment will be collected through PayPal to our PayPal account: {{ sales_email }} .</li>
	    <li>If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we or our business partners may need to correspond with you, process a credit card order, or deliver a product for example, it is out intent to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.</li>
	    <li>{{ sitename }}, the service providers for it, and all vendors providing products or services through our Website use your personal information: to operate our Website and/or effect your transactions; to create and share reports about your transactions among themselves; and to perform credit fraud screening services for transactions between you and us and/or others.</li>
	    <li>We intend to continue improving the content and function of the sites managed by {{ sitename }}. For this reason, we monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us improve the design and layout of our sites and provide content of interest to you.</li>
	  </ul>

We may keep your information for a reasonable period for these purposes. We may need to share your information with our service providers and agents for these purposes, some of whom may be in countries outside Australia, e.g., the USA. If we do so, we will, if appropriate, put a contract in place to ensure that your information is protected. Because of the nature of the products and services we sell, we may have to disclose personal data in order to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</p>

As such, {{ sitename }} may share the password information you provide us with other authorized suppliers. You are solely responsible for the control and use of each password you create.</p>

	  <p>{{ sitename }} may store and disclose personal information as allowed or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (a) protect the rights, safety or property of users of our Website, the public, or {{ sitename }} or our Website suppliers; and (b) conform to legal or regulatory requirements.</p>
